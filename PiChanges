Note - I didn't change yet - the pi uses py 2.7.3 as default interpreter. It has a 3.2 shell too. 
I usually use latest (3.4) unless I need specific library support that's only for 2.7.
We should all use same though - do we all like 3.4 or ?

Set up to do:

Install mysql to work with python:
sudo apt-get install mysql-server python-mysqldb

run mysql and set password to: RRCCpi2DC

Set up pymysql library bindings - I did:
pi@raspberrypi ~/Desktop $ curl -L https://github.com/PyMySQL/PyMySQL/tarball/pymysql-0.6 | tar xz
pi@raspberrypi ~/Desktop $ ls -a
.  ..  changelog  led.py  PyMySQL-PyMySQL-7c86923  repo
pi@raspberrypi ~/Desktop $ cd PyMySql-PyMySql-7c86923
pi@raspberrypi ~/Desktop/PyMySQL-PyMySQL-7c86923 $ sudo python setup.py install

!note! next package needs installed before can install to py3 if py2 is installed already:

pi@raspberrypi ~/Desktop/PyMySQL-PyMySQL-7c86923 $ wget https://bootstrap.pypa.io/ez_setup.py -O - | sudo python3
pi@raspberrypi ~/Desktop/PyMySQL-PyMySQL-7c86923 $ sudo python3 setup.py install
pi@raspberrypi ~/Desktop/PyMySQL-PyMySQL-7c86923 $ cd Desktop
pi@raspberrypi ~/Desktop $ sudo rm -rf PyMySQL-PyMySQL-7c86923

created and dumped db - you should be get the file and use:
mysql -uroot -p < [/path/]db_medbox.sql
